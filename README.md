# PictureBackup

Backup pictures & videos from a computer to an external memory drive

Select one or multiple folders and the program will copy all pictures and videos, based on file extension, to a destination folder of your choice. The directory hierarchy is recreated in the destination folder to keep your files organized.

## Can Improve
* Improve input interface.

* Ensure ample space in destination folder
